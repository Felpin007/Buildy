Use AI-generated responses in a specific format to automatically generate everything and quickly update your codebase.  
We recommend using the best current AI model: [Gemini 2.5 Pro](https://aistudio.google.com)

## How to Use

1.  Install the extension in VS Code.
2.  Use the AI to generate a response in the specified format. (Copy the Windows or Linux version of the prompt)
3.  Paste the response into the extension and click the "Generate" button.
4.  The extension will execute the instructions and update your codebase accordingly.

### Expected AI Format

The AI response must follow this specific XML-like format:

```xml
<text>here is the structure:</text>
<structure>
...structure...
</structure>
<command>mkdir some-folder</command>
<code ref="./path/to/file.js">
// JavaScript code here
function example() {
  return "Hello World";
}
</code>
```

Key components:
- `<text>` tags for regular messages to the user
- `<structure>` tags to display the file structure
- `<command>` tags for terminal commands to execute
- `<code ref="./path/to/file">` tags to create or update files with the content between the tags

## Features

*   **Generate Structure:** Uses AI instructions to automatically create, modify, or delete files and folders.
*   **Execute Commands:** Runs terminal commands directly in VS Code (PowerShell/Bash).
*   **Write Files:** Creates or updates files with the provided content.
*   **Undo:** Restores files to their previous state (requires Git).
*   **Browse Files:** Displays a simple file tree so you can easily copy file contents.
*   **Customizable Prompts:** Add fixed custom instructions to the base prompt to improve AI output.

## Interface

**Structure Generator:** Paste the AI's XML response and click the button to generate. If something goes wrong, click “Undo”.

**Copy System:** Browse your project files, check the ones you want, and copy their content easily.

## Requirements

*   Visual Studio Code (v1.90.0 or higher)
*   Git (required for the undo feature)

## Undo System

The extension uses a "shadow Git" system to provide undo functionality:

* Before executing AI-generated instructions, the extension creates a temporary Git checkpoint
* This allows you to revert changes if something goes wrong
* The undo feature requires Git to be installed on your system
* It works independently from your regular Git workflow and won't interfere with your commits

## Limitations

*   The "Undo" feature is experimental.
*   The AI must follow the format properly, or generation may fail.
*   Some terminal commands might not be handled in all edge cases.

## Security Considerations

* **Review AI Output**: Always review the AI-generated code and commands before executing them
* **Command Execution Risk**: The extension runs terminal commands generated by AI, which could potentially modify your system
* **Use Caution**: Be particularly careful when generating code that includes system commands, network requests, or file operations
* **Undo Safety Net**: While the undo feature provides some protection, it's always best to review changes before applying them
